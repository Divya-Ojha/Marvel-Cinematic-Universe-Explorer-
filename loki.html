        <p>Loki Laufeyson,[1] known by adoption as Loki Odinson and by his title as the God of Mischief,[2][3] is a fictional character portrayed by Tom Hiddleston in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and the Norse mythological god of the same name. Loki was introduced in Thor (2011), and has since become an important recurring figure of the MCU; following the original Loki's death in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), a variant of him from an alternate timeline is introduced in Avengers: Endgame (2019), diverging from the events of The Avengers (2012), headlining the television series Loki (2021) alongside Sylvie, a female variant of him who he works with in the series.<br>

        As of 2023, the character has appeared in eight films, takes the lead role in the live-action series Loki (2021), with a number of alternate timeline variants appearing in Loki, the animated series What If...? (2021),[5] and in The Good, the Bart, and the Loki (2021), an animated short film that serves as a crossover with The Simpsons franchise,[6] including Classic Loki, Kid Loki, Boastful Loki, Alligator Loki, President Loki and more.<br>
        
        Loki's character has borrowed a number of characteristics and storylines from across the history of the character in Marvel Comics. As in the comics, Loki has generally been a villain in the MCU, variously attempting to conquer Asgard or Earth, and having allied himself with more powerful villains to achieve his aims. He has particular antagonism for his adoptive brother Thor, and is known to variously ally with and then betray Thor and others, and to regularly return from apparent death. In his development through the series, he becomes less of a supervillain and more of an antihero.<br>
        <br>
       <strong>Concept and creation</strong><br>
        Loki initially appeared in the science fiction/fantasy anthology Timely Comics' (Marvel Comicâ€™s predecessor) publication Venus No. 6 (August 1949) as a member of the Olympian gods exiled to the Underworld.<br>
        
        However, the current version of Loki made his first official Marvel appearance in Journey into Mystery No. 85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy.<br>
        
        He was introduced by co-writers Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and he was redesigned by Jack Kirby. As one of Thor's arch-nemeses, Loki frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like Journey into Mystery and Thor, as well as other Marvel Universe titles such as The Avengers and X-Men,[7] as well as brief appearances in the Spider-Man and Defenders comic series.<br>
        
        Live-action film adaptations of characters in the Thor comic books were proposed at various times, but did not come to fruition. In the mid-2000s, Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers, which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.[8] In 2006, the film was announced as a Marvel Studios production.[9] In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it "to be like a superhero origin story, but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential. It's the story of an Old Testament god who becomes a New Testament god".[10] In 2008, Guillermo del Toro entered talks to direct the film. Del Toro was a fan of Jack Kirby's work on the comics, and said that he loved the character of Loki, but wished to incorporate more of the original Norse mythology into the film,[11] including a "really dingy Valhalla, [with] Vikings and mud".[12] However, del Toro ultimately turned down Thor to direct The Hobbit. Kenneth Branagh entered into negotiations to direct,[13] and by December 2008, Branagh confirmed that he had been hired. He described it as "a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario."[14]<br>
        
        Several actors were reportedly considered for the part, including Josh Hartnett,[15] and Jim Carrey.[16] In May 2009, Marvel announced that Tom Hiddleston, who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki.[17] In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Chris Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on.[18]</p>
