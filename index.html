<h1>WELCOME TO MARVEL CIENEMATIC UNIVERSE</h1>
<h3>DIRECTORS OF SOME THE FILMS IN MCU</h3>
<h3>Taika Waititi</h3>
<div id="1"><img  src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcTCvBzNnxIkkkVhMMFabWy_uqItb-z3m5MCH_NeKy_58Eioqb0TsQuhzz1ryO4dMQWmq3IexHG9RYGVfpI"></div>
<p>Taika David Cohen ONZM, known professionally as Taika Waititi, is a New Zealand filmmaker, actor and comedian. He is known for directing quirky comedy films and has expanded his career as a voice actor and producer on numerous projects.</p>
<h3>James Gunn</h3>
<div id="2"> <img   src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTlJxKeKJ-til7WzRxcPXJ-MwRz9pvSFiaVUL3ChaWeWR9Hy8Al"></div>
<p>James Francis Gunn Jr. is an American filmmaker and studio executive. He began his career as a screenwriter in the mid-1990s, starting at Troma Entertainment with Tromeo and Juliet.</p>
<h3>Jon Favreau</h3>
<div id="3"><img  src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSagb2wq7B9zZU3zdXyOrf3Zwmuuq304WSCidwK6dopbQ6Y9R4s"></div>
<p>Jon Favreau directed the 2008 superhero film Iron Man, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It's the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and follows Tony Stark as he builds a mechanized suit of armor and becomes the superhero, Iron Man.
<h3>Jon Watts</h3>
<div id="4"><img  src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jon-watts-on-spider-man-homecoming-set-directing-(1).jpeg?q=50&fit=crop&w=750&dpr=1.5"></div>
<p>Jon Watts was the first director in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to direct a trilogy of films. That trilogy is the Spider-Man series of films in the MCU: Homecoming, Far From Home, and No Way Home. Following the Marvel Comics character of the same name, it showed the growth of Peter Parker from a high school kid to a university searching adult.

Watts successfully captained the ship for the MCU's version of Spider-Man, which drew inspiration from John Hughes' films, the first Spidey comic run by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and the controversial comic series One More Day.</p>
Favreau employed improvisation during the film's dialogue scenes to make the film feel more natural. Also, it was improvised because the script wasn't completed when filming began. This led to Robert Downey Jr's depiction as the billionaire playboy becoming immortalized.</p>

<p >The Marvel Cinematic Universe or the MCU is a media franchise created by Marvel Studios and set primarily in a shared universe, with some installments also set in adjacent or branching realities.

Starting with Iron Man, the franchise is comprised mainly of films independently made by Marvel Studios, that are primarily set within this same universe, much like Marvel has done with their comics.

The franchise includes a series of short films, called Marvel One-Shots, launched with several films' Blu-ray releases starting with Thor and finishing with Thor: Ragnarok.

Starting with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., the franchise expanded into television series, including series premiered on the ABC and Freeform channels, and on the Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ streaming platforms. The franchise also includes the news program WHiH Newsfront and the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot.

Other contents include a series of tie-in comics and video games, released as promotional material to the films and series and therefore part of the franchise, even if some of them are set on these branching realities.</p>

 <p>Marvel Studios often puts together a "lookbook" of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for a project. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every "18 months or so" to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU. These lookbooks are not always shown to directors, though, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.[83] When choosing a director for a project, Marvel Studios looks for filmmakers to hire who are able to guide a film,[84] with some of their choices considered "out-of-left-field", given a director's previous work. Feige remarked, "You don't have to have directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome."[85]

The studio ensures directors are open to the idea of the shared universe and are willing to include connective material, such as Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston needing to include Avengers set-up scenes in Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger, respectively.[6] Marvel Studios usually has a big idea they would like to explore or build to in a project, such as Hydra infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D. in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, with it up to the filmmakers to interpret and "improv a little bit" to get there.[86] After these ideas have been developed, the creative team then begins to explore ideas happening in other future projects to see how to make any larger universe connections.[87] There was large amount of collaboration between the Russo brothers and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely with the other Phase Three directors and writers to make sure "everything line[d] up right" for the MCU's "culmination" in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.[88]

Marvel Studios also began contracting their actors for multiple films, including signing actor Samuel L. Jackson to a then "unprecedented" nine-movie contract.[89] Feige said the studio has all actors sign contracts for multiple films, with the norm being for three or more, and the nine or twelve film deals "more rare".[90] The actors' contracts also feature clauses that allows Marvel to use up to three minutes of an actor's performance from one film in another, which Marvel describes as "bridging material".[15] By the start of Phase Four, Marvel Studios was no longer contracting actors for a large number of projects, with deal lengths varying for each actor and project. Feige said the studio was looking for actors who were excited to join the franchise and appear in multiple projects without being locked into contractual obligations. He also noted that they were starting to include theme park attractions in actors' deals.[91]

In August 2012, Marvel signed Joss Whedon to an exclusive contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon would "contribute creatively" on Phase Two of the MCU and develop the first television series set in the universe.[92] In April 2017, James Gunn revealed he would be working with Marvel "to help design where [the Guardians of the Galaxy characters'] stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far".[93] In November 2022, Gunn became co-head of DC Studios, signing a deal for four years and to work exclusively on DC projects.[94] By December 2020, because of the impact COVID-19 had on theaters and film studios shifting away from theatrical releases, Marvel Studios began exploring updated contracts for actors, writers, directors, and producers to receive adjusted compensation in the event a film had to debut on Disney+ instead of in theaters. TheWrap reported it was believed the new contracts would only apply to films about to enter production, and was unclear if any adjustments would be made to contracts for films already completed but not yet released.[95]</p>
