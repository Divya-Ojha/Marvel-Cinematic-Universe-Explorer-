    The Avengers are a team of fictional superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963. Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is a United States-based organization composed primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the world's protection from a variety of threats. The Avengers are depicted as operating in the state of New York: originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and subsequently in the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York. Arranged as an ensemble of core MCU characters originally consisting of Tony Stark / Iron Man, Steve Rogers / Captain America, Thor, Bruce Banner / Hulk, Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, and Clint Barton / Hawkeye, and later expanding to include 16 members. They are central to the MCU's first 23 films, collectively known as the Infinity Saga, and are consequently regarded as an important part of the franchise. The Avengers from alternate universes were depicted in various properties from Phase Four of the MCU, including appearances in the first season of the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021â€“present) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). The Avengers are set to return in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). Both films will be part of the MCU's Phase Six, concluding the Multiverse Saga.

After Avi Arad, the head of Marvel's film division, decided to form Marvel Studios as an independent film studio, producer Kevin Feige envisioned creating a shared universe and introducing the Avengers, similar to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's comic books in the 1960s. After Feige became studio chief in 2007 and formed his creative team, his strategy was to create individual films focused on the major characters for Phase One, beginning with Iron Man (2008) and culminating with The Avengers (2012). Casting for the original six members occurred from 2006 to 2010, beginning with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and concluding with Mark Ruffalo replacing Edward Norton as the Hulk by 2010. Successive installments introduced new members to the team, with actors of MCU characters from the other films reprising their roles. Following the financial and critical success of The Avengers, a sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was subsequently developed, with Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen joining as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, respectively. Then, Captain America: Civil War (2016) was gradually developed into a film influenced by the "Civil War" comic storyline, depicting the division of the Avengers and introducing Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man. A two-part finale consisting of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) was then developed with the intention of concluding the Infinity Saga and depicting their disbandment.

The four Avengers films are currently the third highest-grossing superhero franchise and the sixth highest-grossing film franchise of all-time, grossing more than US$7.7 billion. The Avengers have received praise as a group from critics including their dynamic together, with Endgame being called a perfect conclusion for that iteration of the team. Due to their successful introduction, other film studios set out to create their own shared superhero universes, notably DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Pictures announcing plans to release a Justice League film. Avengers Campus, a series of attractions at various Disney Parks, opened in June 2021 at Disney California Adventure while in July 2021, an immersive family dining experience called "Avengers: Quantum Encounter" at the Worlds of Marvel restaurant on the Disney Wish cruise ship was announced, which debuted when the cruise began voyages on July 14, 2022.

<strong>The Avengers Initiative</strong><br>
In 1995, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury creates the Avengers Initiative, envisioning it as a group of heroes working to respond to planetary threats, following the appearance of Carol Danvers and naming it after her U.S. Air Force callsign, "Avenger".[1][2] Years later, Fury assesses various individuals for it, including Tony Stark[3] and Steve Rogers.[4] Stark's membership is declined after a negative report by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff.[5] The World Security Council wanted Emil Blonsky to join, but rejected it after Stark deters Thaddeus Ross from the idea, hiring Bruce Banner instead.[6]
