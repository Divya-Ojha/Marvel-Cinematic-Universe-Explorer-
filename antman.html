        <p>Scott Lang is a fictional character portrayed by Paul Rudd in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and known commonly by his alias, Ant-Man. He is depicted as a thief-turned-superhero after being granted access to Hank Pym's technology and training, specifically the use of an advanced suit that allows him to change sizes, as well as communicate with ants. He is recruited by Steve Rogers to join the Avengers.<br>

            Following the Blip, Scott lays the groundwork for using time travel as a means to undo Thanos' actions. The Avengers succeed in obtaining the Infinity Stones from alternate timelines and they restore the trillions of lost lives. Scott then participates in the final and victorious battle against Thanos. Scott reunites with his girlfriend Hope van Dyne and daughter Cassie, while also writing a memoir of his life. After being inadvertently trapped in the Quantum Realm, he encounters Kang the Conqueror and prevents him from escaping.<br>
            
            As of 2023, Scott has appeared in five MCU films. An alternate version of the character also appears in the animated series What If...? (2021), with Rudd reprising the role.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Concept, creation and casting</strong><br>
The character of Ant-Man was originally created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, first appearing in Tales to Astonish #35 (September 1962). The persona was originally the brilliant scientist Hank Pym's superhero alias after inventing a substance that can change size. Pym decided to become a superhero after his first wife was killed by corrupt secret police agents during the Cold War. Hank discovered a chemical substance, which he called Pym Particles, that would allow the user to alter his size. He armed himself with a helmet that could control ants and would shrink down to the size of an insect to become the mystery-solving Ant-Man, solving crimes and stopping criminals.[1] Pym shared his discovery with his new girlfriend Janet van Dyne, who became his crime-fighting partner The Wasp.[2] The duo would become founding members of the Avengers, fighting recurring enemies including Pym's own robotic creation Ultron.[3] Scott Lang was a thief who became Ant-Man after stealing the Ant-Man suit to save his daughter Cassandra "Cassie" Lang from a heart condition.[4] Reforming from his life of crime, Scott soon took on a full-time career as Ant-Man with the encouragement of Hank Pym.[5] He became an affiliate of the Fantastic Four,[6] and later became a full-time member of the Avengers.<br>

In the mid-2000s, Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers, which included Ant-Man. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.[7] In 2005, Marvel received a $525 million investment from Merrill Lynch, allowing them to independently produce ten films, including Ant-Man. Edgar Wright had begun developing a live-action film based on the Marvel Comics superhero Ant-Man with Joe Cornish in 2006.[8] However, in May 2014, Wright and Marvel Studios issued a joint statement announcing that Wright had exited the movie due to creative differences.[9] According to Wright, he had been hired as writer-director but became unhappy when Marvel wanted to write a new script. In 2017, he said: "The most diplomatic answer is I wanted to make a Marvel movie but I don't think they really wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie ... having written all my other movies, that's a tough thing to move forward. Suddenly becoming a director for hire on it, you're sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you're there, really."[10]<br>
Wright was replaced by Peyton Reed as director, with Adam McKay and star Paul Rudd rewriting the screenplay. Wright and Cornish received both screenplay and story credits, with Wright also credited as executive producer.[11] Regarding Rudd's casting, producer Kevin Feige said, "Look at that origin of the petty crook who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people's houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in".[12] Director Peyton Reed compared Scott to George Clooney's character Danny Ocean from Ocean's Eleven, saying, "He's a guy trying to create a new life for himself and find redemption". Rudd signed a multi-film contract with Marvel, with Feige saying it was "three[films]-plus-plus to appear in other things".
